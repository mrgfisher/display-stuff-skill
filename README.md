To take utterances and send them via websockets to show on another device's display

## About
Its fun to tinker.

This (simple) skill talks through to another device that acts on the command and will display different sites on its display, think of it as a voice controller kiosk.

## Disclaimer
Not saying that this code is good, or the best way, but it works for me.

## Examples
* "Display clock"
* "Display weather"
* "Display garden summary"
* "Display recipe scones"
